Bash practice

"ls -l" shows if i can read write or exicute files in the 
directory

end bash files with .sh

to make files exicutable run this command in sudo or root
"chmod +x myscript.sh"

to chane the name of a file use "mv" 
"mv old-file-name new-file-name"

to exicute a script in current directory use command 
"./scriptname.sh"

Bash scripts begin with "#!/bin/bash" this allows any shell
to recognize that the file is a bash script
